Subject: Attempting V2 — Chandrakanth

Hi Rajat,

Here is my V2 High Bar submission:
[Insert your new GitHub Link Here, e.g., https://github.com/yourusername/Chandrakanth_HighBar_V2]

**Summary of Improvements:**
*   **Production Pipeline**: Implemented a tight `Data -> Insight -> Creative` loop where every creative recommendation is explicitly linked to a diagnosed performance driver (evidence).
*   **Strict Governance**: Added Pydantic-based schema validation (`src/schema.py`) to enforce data integrity and fail fast on invalid inputs.
*   **Structured Intelligence**: Upgraded `InsightAgent` to produce structured JSON outputs with confidence scores, impact assessments, and specific metric deltas.
*   **Observability**: Implemented run-specific logging (`logs/run_...`) with detailed decision traces for every agent action.
*   **Resilience**: Added a robust error handling layer with custom exceptions and `safe_execute` decorators to prevent silent failures.
*   **Verification**: Added unit tests (`tests/test_v2.py`) to validate the schema and evaluator logic.

**Design Choices:**
*   I chose to use a strict schema validation that raises errors immediately rather than trying to "guess" or fix bad data, to ensure production reliability.
*   The `EvaluatorAgent` now includes a programmatic statistical validation step to ensure confidence scores and evidence are present before the LLM reviews the qualitative aspects.

Best,
Chandrakanth
